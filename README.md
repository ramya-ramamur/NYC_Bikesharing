Interactive vizualization of NYC Bikesharing Data using Tableau Public. 

# NYC_Bikesharing
# Overview
To create a visual bike trip analysis of the NYC Citi Bike System whose results can be used to create a similar ride sharing system in Des Moines. 
For this analysis, weâ€™ll use Pandas to change the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype. Then, using the converted datatype, create a set of visualizations to:

* Show the August Peak Riding Hours/breakdown of annual subscribers vs. short-term customers/Gender breakdown
* Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
* Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
* Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.
* Show the top starting and ending locations

# Resources

-  The bikes used most frequently will probably be the ones that require the most maintenance. The green squares are bike ids that have maximum bike utilization with the yellow squares are ones with moderate usage and the oragne-red ones are those bikes with low usage. The squares also decline in size according to usage. this graph is helpful in determining how many bikes need maintenance. 
 


# Summary
From the visual analysis of the NYC Bikesharing Data, we see that
