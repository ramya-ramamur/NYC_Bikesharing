Interactive vizualization of NYC Bikesharing Data using Tableau Public. 

# NYC_Bikesharing
# Overview
To create a visual bike trip analysis of the NYC Citi Bike System whose results can be used to create a similar ride sharing system in Des Moines. 
For this analysis, weâ€™ll use Pandas to change the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype. Then, using the converted datatype, create a set of visualizations to:

* Show the August Peak Riding Hours/breakdown of annual subscribers vs. short-term customers/Gender breakdown
* Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
* Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
* Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.
* Show the top starting and ending locations
